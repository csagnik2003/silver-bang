A brief representation of the data, acquired after virtual simualtion of the 3D CAD model of the actuator :

Weight of the Actuator: 157 grams
Maximum force the actuator can withstand: 3000 newtons
Safety factor of the hardware: 3.4
Maximum displacement after structural analysis: 2 microns
Thermal expansion analysis (performed at 1000 degree celcius) : After simulation, it was found that the net thermal expansion of the hardware is less than 1mm
