This directory contations a technical presentation created by our team. This presentation primarily focuses on describing the mechanism of our rocket recovery system along with a brief representation of the various hardwares used for the avionics mechanism of the recovery system. The presentation also showed a few lines of code that were designed in Arduino IDE and were tested virtually using the Proteus design and circuit simulator software.
